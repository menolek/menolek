From addictive casual games to immersive multiplayer adventures, I bring the excitement of gaming to players on the go, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable mobile experience.

Equally adept in web-based game development, I leverage my expertise in technologies such as Three.js, Phaser, Pixi, and Cocos2D HTML5 canvas to craft captivating games that can be enjoyed directly in web browsers. From 2D side-scrollers to interactive 3D experiences, I bring joy and entertainment to players worldwide using these powerful frameworks.

In addition, my proficiency in Solidity allows me to develop custom smart contracts that meet the specific requirements of different use cases. I have extensive experience in developing and deploying smart contracts on Ethereum, including ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, and integrating them with web3.js and other Ethereum development tools such as Truffle, Hardhat and Remix. 

As a full-stack developer, I have experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including popular libraries such as jQuery, Lodash, and Bootstrap. I have also worked extensively with Git, using  Git workflows such as git-flow and GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Deployment. 

I am passionate about building high-quality software, staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in software development, and sharing my knowledge with others through blogs and open-source contributions.
